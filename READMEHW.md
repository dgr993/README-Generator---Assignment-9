#README.md Generator
I created a node.js process to walk a user through creating a readme file. The file includes a title, description, instructions, etc. to be fully fleshed out and professional.

i ran into issues of changing design but resolved it with the markdown websites as guides. I enjoyed learning about a new way to use js and was able to fully flesh out a working model that does what i ask it to do.

to initiate document you must type node index.js into the terminal. then follow the prompts to create your readme.
